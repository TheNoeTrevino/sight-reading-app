### Goal

This project is deigned for music student 6th through 12th in public school. 
I want a one stop shop where educators can send students to practice their specific music, sight reading, and much more.

This also be a technical exercise for myself as I will be learning a huge amount of things on the way.

## Technologies used:

### Frontend

React

TypeScript

OpenSheetMusicDisplay - Display the xml files on the web browser

### Backend

Music21 - Generate the midi and xml files as needed

Django - Complementing the music21 library very well

...planning on adding java for database interaction and user authentication
